# Vanadin

**A modern, fast and powerful building and testing framework.**

## Goals

- 🚀 Powerful building & testing tools.
- 🌐 Universal, made for all languages & all projects.
- 📦 Lightweight and robust workflow.
- 💫 Easy & extensible development.
- ⚡ Lightning fast task execution.

## Getting Started

To install Vanadin, run `cargo install vanadin`.

Once installed, run `vanadin init` to initialize a `.vanadin` folder in your project.\
Now you are able to specify tasks in the `.vanadin/Vanadin.toml` file and create your own scripts.\
The default script location is `.vanadin/tasks/...`, so it's good practice to begin your jouney here.
