# Installation of Vanadin

To install Vanadin, you have two options:
- Install Vanadin via Cargo
- Install Vanadin manually

## Installing Vanadin via Cargo
If you do not have cargo, you can install it by following the [Official Installation Guide of Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

After you installed Cargo, run `cargo install vanadin` to install Vanadin.

To validate the installation, you can run `vanadin info` and you should see something like this:
```
[INFO] Running Vanadin v0.1.0
[INFO] Blazingly fast building and testing framework.
[INFO] Made by DraftedDev
```
